Transform,Advantages,Disadvantages
DFT,"• Simple and straightforward
• No size restrictions
• Exact mathematical definition
• Easy to understand","• Very slow O(N²) complexity
• Impractical for large N
• Memory intensive
• No computational optimizations"
FFT,"• Very fast computation O(N log N)
• Highly optimized implementations
• Widely supported in hardware/software
• Excellent for power-of-2 sizes","• Limited to uniform sampling
• Less efficient for non-power-of-2
• Fixed frequency resolution
• No zoom capability"
CZT,"• Flexible frequency sampling
• Zoom capability for spectral analysis
• Arbitrary contour evaluation
• High resolution in specific bands","• More complex implementation
• Higher memory requirements
• Overhead for small transforms
• Less optimized than FFT"
